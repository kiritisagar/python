In Python, file handling involves performing various operations on files such as reading, writing, and appending data to them. 
Python provides several built-in functions for working with files, which makes file handling easy and efficient.

Here’s a detailed explanation of the key file functions in Python:

# 1.Opening a File [open()` function]:
The `open()` function is used to open a file in Python. It requires two arguments: 
- filename (the name of the file),
- mode (the mode in which the file is to be opened).

#### Syntax:
file_object = open(filename, mode)

#### Modes for opening a file:
- 'r': Read (default mode) – Opens a file for reading. Error if the file does not exist.
- 'w': Write – Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it doesn’t exist, and If the file exists, it erases all content and starts fresh.
- 'a': Append – Opens a file for appending data. Creates the file if it doesn’t exist. Adds data at the end.
- 'x': Create – Creates the file if it doesn’t exist. Error if the file exists.
- 'b': Binary mode – Opens a file in binary format (e.g., images).
- 't': Text mode (default mode) – Opens a file in text mode.

#### Example:
file = open('example.txt', 'r')  # Open file in read mode

# 1.Reading a File:
There are multiple ways to read content from a file:

- **`read()`**: Reads the entire content of the file.
- **`readline()`**: Reads one line from the file at a time.
- **`readlines()`**: Reads all lines of the file into a list, where each line is an element.

Use read() when you want the full content of the file as a single string.
Use readlines() when you need to work with each line of the file separately.


# Example:
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
content = file.read()  # Read the entire file
print(content)
file.close()  # Close the file after use


- **Example with `readline()`**:
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
line = file.readline()  # Read the first line
print(line)
file.close()

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Writing to a File:
You can write data to a file using:
- write(): Writes a string to the file.
- writelines(): Writes a list of strings to the file.

# Example:
file = open('example.txt', 'w')  # Open file in write mode
file.write('Hello, World!\n')  # Write a string to the file
file.close()


- Example with `writelines():
file = open('example.txt', 'w')
lines = ['First line\n', 'Second line\n']
file.writelines(lines)  # Write multiple lines to the file
file.close()

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3.Appending to a File:
When you open a file in append mode (`'a'`), the data is written at the end of the file without overwriting the existing content.

#### Example:
file = open('example.txt', 'a')  # Open file in append mode
file.write('This is an appended line.\n')
file.close()

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4.Closing a File (`close()` function):
Always close the file after performing file operations to free up system resources and to ensure that data is properly written to the file. 

#### Example:
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
# Perform file operations
file.close()  # Close the file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
r+ vs w+
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# r+ (Read and Write Mode)
File Creation: Does not create a new file if it doesn't exist; it raises an error instead.
Content Handling: Allows reading from the file and writing to it. The file's existing content is preserved.
File Pointer: Starts at the beginning; you can read and then write.
Use Case: Use r+ when you want to read the existing content and then modify it without losing any data.


# w+ (Write and Read Mode)
File Creation: Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist.
Content Handling: Overwrites the entire file if it exists; all existing content is lost.
File Pointer: Starts at the beginning, allowing both reading and writing.
Use Case: Use w+ when you want to write new content to a file, regardless of whether it already exists or not.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. w vs append
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
w (Write Mode)
File Creation: Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist.
Content Handling: Erases all existing content if the file exists.
File Pointer: Starts at the beginning, and new content replaces any old content.
Use Case: Use w when you want to start fresh and don't need the previous data.

append (Append Mode)
File Creation: Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist.
Content Handling: Preserves existing content and adds new data at the end.
File Pointer: Starts at the end of the file for writing.
Use Case: Use append when you want to keep existing data and add new content to the end.
