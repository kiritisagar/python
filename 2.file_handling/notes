In Python, file handling involves performing various operations on files such as reading, writing, and appending data to them. 
Python provides several built-in functions for working with files, which makes file handling easy and efficient.

Here’s a detailed explanation of the key file functions in Python:

# 1.Opening a File [open()` function]:
The `open()` function is used to open a file in Python. It requires two arguments: 
- filename (the name of the file),
- mode (the mode in which the file is to be opened).

#### Syntax:
file_object = open(filename, mode)

#### Modes for opening a file:
- 'r': Read (default mode) – Opens a file for reading. Error if the file does not exist.
- 'w': Write – Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it doesn’t exist, and If the file exists, it erases all content and starts fresh.
- 'a': Append – Opens a file for appending data. Creates the file if it doesn’t exist. Adds data at the end.
- 'x': Create – Creates the file if it doesn’t exist. Error if the file exists.
- 'b': Binary mode – Opens a file in binary format (e.g., images).
- 't': Text mode (default mode) – Opens a file in text mode.

#### Example:
file = open('example.txt', 'r')  # Open file in read mode

# 1.Reading a File:
There are multiple ways to read content from a file:

- **`read()`**: Reads the entire content of the file.
- **`readline()`**: Reads one line from the file at a time.
- **`readlines()`**: Reads all lines of the file into a list, where each line is an element.

Use read() when you want the full content of the file as a single string.
Use readlines() when you need to work with each line of the file separately.


# Example:
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
content = file.read()  # Read the entire file
print(content)
file.close()  # Close the file after use


- **Example with `readline()`**:
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
line = file.readline()  # Read the first line
print(line)
file.close()

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Writing to a File:
You can write data to a file using:
- write(): Writes a string to the file.
- writelines(): Writes a list of strings to the file.

# Example:
# Example:
file = open('example.txt', 'w')  # Open file in write mode
content = "hello"
file.write(content)  # Write a string to the file
file.close()

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3.Appending to a File:
When you open a file in append mode (`'a'`), the data is written at the end of the file without overwriting the existing content.

#### Example:
file = open('example.txt', 'a')  # Open file in append mode
file.write('This is an new line')
file.close()

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.r+ mode:
it is used for opening a file with both read and write permissions.
The file must already exist for this mode to work. 
If the file does not exist, an error (specifically, a FileNotFoundError) will be raised.
When you open a file in r+ mode, the cursor (file pointer) starts at the beginning of the file.
If you write to the file without moving the cursor, it will overwrite the existing content from the start.
To add new content at the end of the file, move the cursor to the end first with file.seek(0, 2).

# example:
file = open("munna.txt", "r+")  # This mode allows you to read and write
file.seek(0, 2)  # Move the cursor to the end
content = "its new lie22"  # Define the new content to write
file.write(content)  # Write the new content to the file
file.close()  # Close the file

# explanation:
The file.seek(0, 2) function is used in Python to move the file pointer (cursor) to a specific position within a file. 

Explanation of file.seek(0, 2)
Function Purpose:
The seek() method changes the current position of the file pointer.
Parameters:
The 0 means "move 0 bytes" from the position you want to start at.
The 2 means you are starting from the end of the file.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4.Closing a File (`close()` function):
Always close the file after performing file operations to free up system resources and to ensure that data is properly written to the file. 

#### Example:
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
# Perform file operations
file.close()  # Close the file

r+ vs w+
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# r+ (Read and Write Mode)
File Creation: Does not create a new file if it doesn't exist; it raises an error instead.
Content Handling: Allows reading from the file and writing to it. The file's existing content is preserved.
File Pointer: Starts at the beginning; you can read and then write.
Use Case: Use r+ when you want to read the existing content and then modify it without losing any data.


# w+ (Write and Read Mode)
File Creation: Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist.
Content Handling: Overwrites the entire file if it exists; all existing content is lost.
File Pointer: Starts at the beginning, allowing both reading and writing.
Use Case: Use w+ when you want to write new content to a file, regardless of whether it already exists or not.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. w vs append
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
w (Write Mode)
File Creation: Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist.
Content Handling: Erases all existing content if the file exists.
File Pointer: Starts at the beginning, and new content replaces any old content.
Use Case: Use w when you want to start fresh and don't need the previous data.

append (Append Mode)
File Creation: Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist.
Content Handling: Preserves existing content and adds new data at the end.
File Pointer: Starts at the end of the file for writing.
Use Case: Use append when you want to keep existing data and add new content to the end.
