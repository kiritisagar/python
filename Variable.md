## Variable Naming Rules:
**RULE:1**
Start with a letter or underscore (_): Variable names cannot start with a number.

**RULE:2**
Use only alphanumeric characters and underscores (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _): Special characters like @, $, and % are not allowed.

**RULE:3**
No spaces allowed: Variable names cannot contain spaces; use underscores (_) instead to separate words.

**RULE:4**
Avoid reserved words: Don't use Python keywords (like for, while, class, True, etc.) as variable names.
