Booleans are represent one of two possible values: True or False. 
They are often used to make decisions in your code, such as controlling the flow of a program with conditions.

# Key Characteristics of Booleans:
Two Values: The Boolean type can only hold two values:

True: Represents a logical truth.
False: Represents a logical falsehood.


# Boolean Operations
Python allows you to perform logical operations that yield Boolean values:

A. Logical AND (and): Returns True if both operands are True.
a = True
b = False
print(a and b)  # Output: False

B.Logical OR (or): Returns True if at least one operand is True.
print(a or b)  # Output: True

C.Logical NOT (not): Reverses the value of the operand.
print(not a)  # Output: False
