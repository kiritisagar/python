Data types allocate the memory spaces to store the inputs

Here’s a simple way to think about the main data types:

1. **Numbers**: For counting or calculations.
   - `int` is for whole numbers like 1, 10, or -5.
   - `float` is for numbers with decimals like 3.14 or -2.5.

2. **Text**: For words or sentences.
   - `str` (string) is for sequences of characters like "hello" or "Python is fun."

3. **True or False**: For yes/no or true/false situations.
   - `bool` is for Boolean values, which are just `True` or `False`.

4. **Lists of Items**: For storing multiple things in one place.
   - `list` is like a collection you can change, e.g., `[1, 2, "apple"]`.
   - `tuple` is like a list but can’t be changed once set, e.g., `(1, 2, "apple")`.

5. **Key-Value Pairs**: For matching things up, like a dictionary.
   - `dict` is for pairs, like `{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}`, where each key (e.g., 'name') has a value (e.g., 'Alice').

6. **Unique Items**: For storing only unique things.
   - `set` is for collections with no duplicates, like `{1, 2, 3}`.

Each data type has its own purpose and makes handling data easier and more organized.
