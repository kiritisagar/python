Tuples in Python are similar to lists but have some key differences. 
Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of tuples, including how to create them, access their elements, and their characteristics.

What is a Tuple?
A tuple is an ordered collection of elements.
Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.
Tuples can contain elements of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, floats).
Creating a Tuple
You can create a tuple by enclosing elements in parentheses ().

Example: Creating a Tuple

# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

# Printing the tuple
print(my_tuple)  # Output: ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
