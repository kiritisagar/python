# integer(int):
Represents whole numbers, without any decimal points.
Example: 1, -5, 42, 1000

# int example
x = 10  # whole number
print(x)  # Output: 10 (the value of x)
# Check the type of x
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>

# float:
Definition: Represents numbers with decimal points, allowing for fractional values.
Example: 3.14, -0.001, 123.456

# Characteristics:
Can store both whole numbers and fractional values.
Uses more memory than an int because it needs to store both the integer part and the fractional part.
A float is typically stored using 4 bytes (32 bits) and can represent approximately 7 digits of precision.


# float example
y = 3.14  # number with a decimal
print(y)  # Output: 3.14 (the value of y)
# Check the type of y
print(type(y))  # Output: <class 'float'>
