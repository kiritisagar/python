# Variables 
In Python, a variable is a name used to store data in the program. 
The value stored in a variable can change during program execution. 
A variable essentially points to a memory location where the data is stored.

# Data Types
Variables store data, and Python automatically detects the type of variable.
Data types specify the type of data a variable can hold. 
Python has various built-in data types, and Python dynamically assigns the type based on the value assigned.


name = "Alice"      # String
age = 25            # Integer
height = 5.4        # Float
is_student = True   # Boolean


# Common Data Types:
# 1.Integer (int): 
Stores whole numbers.

age = 30  # Integer value

# 2.Float (float): 
Stores decimal numbers.

temperature = 36.6  # Float value

# 3.String (str): 

name = "sagar"
print(name)

# Explanation:
Assignment:
name = "sagar": The variable name is assigned the string "sagar". A string is a sequence of characters inside quotes.

Print Function:
print(name): The print() function is used to output the value of name. It will print the exact string value "sagar" to the console.

# i.string concatenation :
String concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings together into a single string.

In your example:
string1 = "sagar"
string2 = "munna"

result = string1 + " " + string2
print(result)

# ii. String Methods:
Common methods include:
lower() – Converts all characters to lowercase.
upper() – Converts all characters to uppercase.
strip() – Removes any leading/trailing whitespace.
replace() – Replaces a substring with another.
find() – Finds a substring's index.

# a.Boolean (bool): Stores True or False.
is_active = True  # Boolean value

# b.List (list): Stores an ordered collection of items (mutable).
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  # List value

# c.Tuple (tuple): Stores an ordered collection of items (immutable).
coordinates = (10, 20)  # Tuple value

# d.Dictionary (dict): Stores key-value pairs.
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}  # Dictionary value

# e.Set (set): Stores an unordered collection of unique items.
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  # Set value
