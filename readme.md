# Variables and Data Types
Variables store data, and Python automatically detects the type of variable.

name = "Alice"      # String
age = 25            # Integer
height = 5.4        # Float
is_student = True   # Boolean

# String

name = "sagar"
print(name)

# Explanation:
Assignment:
name = "sagar": The variable name is assigned the string "sagar". A string is a sequence of characters inside quotes.

Print Function:
print(name): The print() function is used to output the value of name. It will print the exact string value "sagar" to the console.

string concatenation :
String concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings together into a single string.

In your example:
string1 = "sagar"
string2 = "munna"

result = string1 + " " + string2
print(result)

2. String Methods:
Common methods include:
lower() – Converts all characters to lowercase.
upper() – Converts all characters to uppercase.
strip() – Removes any leading/trailing whitespace.
replace() – Replaces a substring with another.
find() – Finds a substring's index.
