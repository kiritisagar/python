Used to compare objects to check if they are the same object in memory.

Operator	Description	Example
is	Returns True if both variables are the same object	a is b
is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	a is not b
Example:
python
Copy code
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
c = a

print(a is c)      # True (a and c refer to the same object)
print(a is b)      # False (a and b refer to different objects with the same value)
print(a == b)      # True (a and b have the same values)
These operators are fundamental in Python and are used across all types of programming tasks.
