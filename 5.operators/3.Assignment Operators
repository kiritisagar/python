Used to assign values to variables.

Operator	Description	Example
=	Assign	a = 10
+=	Add and assign	a += 2 → a = a+2
-=	Subtract and assign	a -= 2 → a = a-2
*=	Multiply and assign	a *= 3 → a = a*3
/=	Divide and assign	a /= 2 → a = a/2
%=	Modulus and assign	a %= 2 → a = a%2
**=	Power and assign	a **= 3 → a = a**3


Example:
python
Copy code
x = 5
x += 3  # Equivalent to x = x + 3, so x becomes 8
print(x)

x *= 2  # Equivalent to x = x * 2, so x becomes 16
print(x)
