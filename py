In Python, a dictionary (dict) is a mapping type that stores data in the form of key-value pairs. It’s highly efficient for lookups, insertion, and deletion based on keys.

 Error Handling (Exceptions)
In Python, errors can be managed using try-except blocks, ensuring that the program doesn’t crash.

Example
python
Copy code
try:
    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
finally:
    print("This will always run.")  # Final block to clean up resources
