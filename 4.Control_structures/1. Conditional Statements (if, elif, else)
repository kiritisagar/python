The structure includes if, elif (else if), and else. 
The program checks the conditions in order, and the first condition that evaluates to True will trigger the corresponding code block. 
If none of the conditions are met, the else block will be executed.

## Syntax of if, elif, else::
if condition1:
    # Code to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Code to execute if condition1 is False and condition2 is True
else:
    # Code to execute if all conditions are False

1.1 Simple if statement:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A simple if statement in Python checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is True. 
If the condition is False, the block of code inside the if statement is skipped, and the program continues with the next part of the code.

## example:
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")


## Explanation:
Condition: The condition in the if statement is x > 5. It checks if the value of x is greater than 5.
Execution: If the condition evaluates to True (which it does in this case, since x = 10), the code inside the if block is executed.
Skip if False: If the condition were False (e.g., x = 3), the code inside the if block would be skipped
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1.2 if-else Statement:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The if-else statement allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is true and a different block of code if the condition is false. 
Essentially, the if checks the condition, and if it evaluates to True, the code inside the if block runs. If the condition is False, the else block runs.


x = 3
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")

explanation:
Condition: The condition in the if statement is x > 5. It checks whether x is greater than 5.
True Path: If the condition is True (i.e., x > 5), the message "x is greater than 5" will be printed.
False Path: If the condition is False (i.e., x <= 5), the else block will execute, and the message "x is less than or equal to 5" will be printed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1.3 if-elif-else statement:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The if-elif-else statement is used when you want to check multiple conditions sequentially. 
If the first if condition is false, the elif (short for "else if") conditions are checked in order. 
If none of the if or elif conditions are true, the else block is executed.

age = 16

if age < 13:
    print("You are a child.")
elif age < 18:
    print("You are a teenager.")
else:
    print("You are an adult.")

Explanation:
The first condition checks if age < 13. If true, it prints "You are a child."
If the first condition is false, the program checks the next condition age < 18. If this is true, it prints "You are a teenager."
If both conditions are false, the else block executes and prints "You are an adult."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1.4 Nested if Statements:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A nested if statement is when you use an if statement inside another if or else block. 
This allows you to check multiple conditions in a more complex decision-making process.

x = 10
y = 20

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
    if y > 15:
        print("y is greater than 15")
    else:
        print("y is less than or equal to 15")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")


Explanation:
The first if checks if x > 5. Since x = 10, this condition is true, and it prints "x is greater than 5".
Inside the first if block, there's another if that checks if y > 15. Since y = 20, this condition is also true, so it prints "y is greater than 15".
If x was less than or equal to 5, the program would skip the inner if and go to the else block.
